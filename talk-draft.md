**40 Minutes including all Q/A**s

Many lifetimes ago, I worked as a barista at a popular coffe shop.  We'll call it..."Ruby Bucks".

At this cafe, as we completed a drink, we would call it out:

Venti, quad shot, extra hot, extra whip, heavy cream white mocha for Bill!

Then set it on the counter and move on to the next drink with the expectation that Bill would retrieve his drink in a timely fashion.

On occasion, a curious thing would happen....a few minutes would go by and Bill would come up to the counter to see if his drink was ready.  We'd look over to where we had set his cup just to discover...it was gone.

It seems that someone had discovered a vulnerability in the Ruby Bucks system. There was a brief moment between the time where I set the drink out and when Bill picked the drink up when nobody was watching the drink.  In that moment, it was simple for someone sketchy caffeine addict to abscond with coffee that didn't belong to them.

Which brings me to our topic - safety and security in coffee shops.

Wait....that doesn't sound right....hmmm...maybe save that for a java conference.

So...we're web developers which is awesome because we don't have to worry about people stealing 


Our web applications have similar vulnerabilites.  A brief moment in time, where, if we're not careful, no one is minding the database and shady characters can walk off with something more valuable than coffee.  And, I know what you're thinking...."We're developers!  There's nothing more valuable than coffee."  But, in this case, there is...it's your customer's private information.
